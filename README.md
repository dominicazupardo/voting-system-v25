# Voting System for CCDI Students by Dominic Azupardo and Company

This project is designed to enhance the election system for students at CCDI (College/University name). The goal is to create a secure, user-friendly, and transparent voting platform that makes the election process efficient and accessible for all students.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface**: An intuitive web and mobile-friendly interface for easy participation.
- **Transparency & Integrity**: Blockchain or secure encryption to ensure tamper-proof votes and real-time tracking of votes.
- **Efficient Voting Process**: Simplified voting flow with automatic validation using student credentials.
- **Multi-Language & Accessibility Support**: Multi-language options and accessibility features for diverse students.
- **Digital Campaigning**: Candidates can post their manifestos, engage with voters, and answer questions.
- **Secure & Anonymous Voting**: Ensures voter privacy and security.
- **Real-Time Reporting & Feedback**: View live results, provide feedback, and report issues during elections.
- **Post-Election Auditability**: Enable independent audits of the election for fairness and transparency.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To get this project up and running locally, you’ll need the following software:

- **Node.js** (version 14.x or higher)
- **npm** (Node Package Manager)
- **Database** (PostgreSQL/MySQL or Firebase)
- **Cloud hosting provider** (e.g., AWS, Heroku)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/voting-system.git
   cd voting-system
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up the database:
   - Create a PostgreSQL/MySQL or Firebase database.
   - Configure the database connection in the `.env` file (see the example below).

4. Configure your environment variables:
   Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add the necessary configurations:
   ```
   DB_HOST=your-database-host
   DB_PORT=your-database-port
   DB_USER=your-database-user
   DB_PASSWORD=your-database-password
   DB_NAME=your-database-name
   JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret
   ```

5. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

6. Open the application in your browser:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

## Usage

- **Voting**: Students can log in with their credentials, view candidate profiles, and vote securely and anonymously.
- **Candidate Campaigning**: Candidates can upload their manifestos, interact with voters, and respond to questions.
- **Election Monitoring**: Administrators can view real-time vote counts and ensure transparency throughout the process.

### Key Changes:
- **Project Name**: Changed the name to `voting-system` to align with your application's name.
- **Updated Terminology**: All references to the system are now consistent with "Voting System" (e.g., "Voting," "Vote counts," etc.).
- **Structure**: The rest of the structure remains the same with a focus on setting up, using, and contributing to the system.

This version should now clearly reflect your project as the "Voting System" for CCDI students. Let me know if you'd like further adjustments!
